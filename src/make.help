Useful targets of the one makefile:

default
all
install
clean
help
----
Variables normally set by configure can be overridden:
make CXXFLAGS=-g\ -O0
debug=nonempty-string will spit out a little bit of useless information

Less useful targets:
%.d, %.o, %.s %.ii
bin/%, bin/%-test, lib/%.a
%/objects, %/asms, %/mains, %/tests, %/libs
%/bins, %/default, %/all; %/main, %/test, %/lib
none, objects, asms, mains, tests, libs, bins,
